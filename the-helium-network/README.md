# üéà The Helium Network

In 2013, [Helium](../helium-glossary.md#helium) began trying to tackle the global [wireless](../helium-glossary.md#wireless) problem: A lack of ubiquity. In order for any entity to provide global [coverage](../helium-glossary.md#coverage) required local contracts based on the regional standards. It wasn‚Äôt until 2019, that the Helium network as we know it now began to form.

### Helium

Summer of 2019 in Austin TX, a group of core engineers envisioned a [peer-to-peer network](../helium-glossary.md#peer-to-peer-network) that would be used to provide coverage to [IoT](../helium-glossary.md#iot) [sensors](../helium-glossary.md#sensor). Little did they realize Covid-19 was about to put the world on lockdown. This gave them time to connect, and work with organizations who would wind up playing integral roles in Helium‚Äôs genesis, but also drove home the impact of supply chain issues, resource scarcity, infrastructure inequality, and many other issues that were being exacerbated by the pandemic.\
\
[Helium Foundation](https://www.helium.foundation/), which at that time was known as Decentralized Wireless Alliance, fosters research and development where [p2p](../helium-glossary.md#p2p) and [blockchain](../helium-glossary.md#blockchain) innovation intersect with [radio](../helium-glossary.md#radio) [hardware](../helium-glossary.md#hardware) and [sensor](../helium-glossary.md#sensor) development. In 2022, Helium and DeWi acquired an additional $200 million, after which Helium‚Äôs core developers underwent a name change to become [Nova Labs](https://nova.xyz/), and DeWi became [Helium Foundation](./#foundation). \

### Foundation

Helium Foundation, previously known as Decentralized Wireless Alliance, had the [Helium](../helium-glossary.md#helium) brand assets transferred to them by [Nova Labs](../helium-glossary.md#nova-nova-labs). Helium Foundation oversees an extensive grant program that provides individuals and groups funding, technical support, and community resources for projects that help accelerate the growth of the Helium ecosystem.

Learn more on their website, where you can also apply for a grant directly. [Helium Foundation](https://www.helium.foundation/)&#x20;

### [Blockchain](../helium-glossary.md#blockchain)

The [Helium Blockchain](../helium-glossary.md#helium-blockchain) is the framework on which the Helium network is built. The blockchain hosts historical [HNT](../helium-glossary.md#hnt) transaction [data](../helium-glossary.md#data), new transactions made, and rules about how the [software](../helium-glossary.md#software) functions.

### ****[**IoT**](../helium-glossary.md#iot)****

[Wireless](../helium-glossary.md#wireless) devices that have low [data](../helium-glossary.md#data) requirements are able to send and receive information over long distance [radio](../helium-glossary.md#radio) [transmissions](../helium-glossary.md#transmission). From environmental [sensors](../helium-glossary.md#sensor) that monitor weather, to tracking devices to keep tabs on logistical assets like packages or trucks, the [Internet of Things](../helium-glossary.md#internet-of-things) provides [coverage](../helium-glossary.md#coverage) to these devices on a wide personal and industrial scale.&#x20;

As the [Helium Coverage map](../helium-glossary.md#helium-coverage-map) continues to grow, electric scooter rental companies for example, will be able to negotiate [service](../helium-glossary.md#service) contracts with [Helium](../helium-glossary.md#helium) based on the coverage in their area. You can help fill in the map in your region which will help promote sensor usage, network growth, and in turn promote longevity of the [Helium token. ](../helium-glossary.md#hnt)

[Here](https://news.rakwireless.com/make-a-helium-mapper-with-the-wisblock/) is a great guide on how to get started from scratch or using a [RAK Helium Mapper Kit](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/helium-mapper-kit?variant=41259355701446)

### [Mining](../helium-glossary.md#mining)

Every epoch, the [consensus](../helium-glossary.md#consensus) group [mines](../helium-glossary.md#mining) approximately 30 [blocks](../helium-glossary.md#block). [Hotspots](../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) are [rewarded](../helium-glossary.md#reward) for the various work they perform, and are rewarded according to the following distribution:\


| <ul><li><a href="../helium-glossary.md#proof-of-coverage">PoC</a> <a href="../helium-glossary.md#challenge">Challenger</a></li></ul> |   | [Rewarded](../helium-glossary.md#reward) to any [Hotspot](../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) that creates a valid PoC challenge and submits the corresponding receipt to the [blockchain](../helium-glossary.md#blockchain). |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

&#x20;

| <ul><li>PoC Challengees</li></ul> |   | Awarded to any Hotspot that transmits a PoC [packet](../helium-glossary.md#packet) after being targeted by the challenger. |
| --------------------------------- | - | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

&#x20;

| <ul><li><a href="../helium-glossary.md#witness">Witnesses</a></li></ul> |   | Distributed to all Hotspots that witness a beacon packet as part of a PoC Challenge. |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

\
\


| <ul><li><a href="../helium-glossary.md#consensus">Consensus</a> Group</li></ul> |   | Divided equally among the [Validators](../helium-glossary.md#validator) that are part of the outgoing Consensus Group, responsible for [mining](../helium-glossary.md#mining) [blocks](../helium-glossary.md#block). |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

&#x20;

| <ul><li>Security</li></ul>                                                                |   | Awarded to Helium, Inc and other Network investors who hold Security Tokens.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <ul><li>Network <a href="../helium-glossary.md#data-transfer">Data Transfer</a></li></ul> |   | <p>Distributed each epoch to Hotspots that route <a href="../helium-glossary.md#lorawan">LongFi</a> <a href="../helium-glossary.md#sensor">sensor</a> <a href="../helium-glossary.md#data">data</a> for sensors on the Network during that epoch.</p><p><br><br></p> |

Below are the mining rewards per epoch as of August 1, 2021. For every complete epoch, marked by the election of a new Consensus Group, all the [HNT](../helium-glossary.md#hnt) produced are distributed over the following reward types:

| **Reward Type**       | **Percentage**  | **HNT Earned by Reward Type** |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| PoC Challenger        | 0.90% - 2.11%   | 15.6250 - 36.6319             |
| PoC Challengees       | 5.02% - 11.78%  | 87.1527 - 204.5139            |
| Witnesses             | 20.08% - 47.11% | 348.6111 - 817.8819           |
| Consensus Group       | 6%              | 104.1666                      |
| Security Tokens       | 33%             | 572.9166                      |
| Network Data Transfer | _Up to 35%_     | _Up to 607.6389_              |
| Total                 | 100%            | 1736.1111                     |

### Light vs [Full Hotspots ](../helium-glossary.md#full-hotspots)&#x20;

Before [Light Hotspots](../helium-glossary.md#light-hotspots), hotspots were required to [sync](../helium-glossary.md#sync) with the [blockchain](../helium-glossary.md#blockchain). These hotspots are now referred to colloquially as Full Hotspots, to distinguish them from their new function, Light Hotspots. The [proof of coverage](../helium-glossary.md#proof-of-coverage) remains the same, but rather than using the computational power required to sync to the blockchain, validator‚Äôs now sync on the half of hotspots, as well as submit challenges to beacon. This allows our hotspots to provide more consistent proof of coverage, which leads to better rewards.&#x20;

### [Validators](../helium-glossary.md#validator)

Validators help distribute and [decentralize](../helium-glossary.md#decentralized) the [network](../helium-glossary.md#network). They verify transaction data, perform [consensus mechanisms](../helium-glossary.md#consensus-mechanism), [challenge](../helium-glossary.md#challenge) [hotspots](../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) to submit [beacons](../helium-glossary.md#beacon), and add new [blocks](../helium-glossary.md#block) to the [blockchain](../helium-glossary.md#blockchain). Validators must [stake](../helium-glossary.md#stake) 10,000HNT against their participation, which will be forfeited in the event they attempt to cheat the network. Over 30% of all [HNT](../helium-glossary.md#hnt) in circulation is currently locked in stake, which provides security to its investors.&#x20;

[Consensus](../helium-glossary.md#consensus) is a fault-tolerant mechanism used in computer [blockchain](../helium-glossary.md#blockchain) systems to verify an agreed upon single value, or set of data. This allows [validators](../helium-glossary.md#validator) to prove the work they've performed qualifies them for the right to add a [block](../helium-glossary.md#block) to the [blockchain](../helium-glossary.md#blockchain). &#x20;

### Data-Only Hotspots

Data Only hotspots perform [data transfer](../helium-glossary.md#data-transfer) in exchange for [rewards](../helium-glossary.md#reward) on the network, but are ineligible for [Proof of Coverage](../helium-glossary.md#proof-of-coverage) rewards. Since they do not perform [PoC](../helium-glossary.md#proof-of-coverage), they can be added to the [blockchain](../helium-glossary.md#blockchain) without permission. There are many DIY instructions available for building your own Data Only hotspot, but keep in mind you will only be rewarded [HNT](../helium-glossary.md#hnt) for transferring [data](../helium-glossary.md#data).&#x20;

### [Network](../helium-glossary.md#network) Usage

The [Helium](../helium-glossary.md#helium) Network currently provides [LoRaWAN](../helium-glossary.md#lorawan) to [IoT](../helium-glossary.md#iot) devices, from weather [sensors](../helium-glossary.md#sensor) to electric scooters and bikes, and is in the process of rolling out an ambitious 5G global network. Learn more [here](https://www.helium.com/5G). The future of [HNT](../helium-glossary.md#hnt) mining rewards will be based on the quantity of [data transfer ](../helium-glossary.md#data-transfer)taking place over the network. You may find setting up your own sensors to not only add use-case utility to Helium, but to also be a lot of fun. All out-door enclosures should be equipped with a temperature/humidity sensor to monitor your [hardware's](../helium-glossary.md#hardware) exposure to the elements. If you'd like to get started with sensors, check out the [Awesome-Helium GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dansku/awesome-helium) which will get you acquainted with a variety of useful tools, and tips that can greatly enhance your Helium [mining](../helium-glossary.md#mining).\
