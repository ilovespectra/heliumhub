# Grounding

If your [hotspot](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) ceases performing [proof of coverage](../../helium-glossary.md#proof-of-coverage), this could be due to your [antenna](../../helium-glossary.md#antenna) or [coax](../../helium-glossary.md#coax) being damaged by [static](../../helium-glossary.md#static) discharge. No lightning is required for this type of damage, and it will be challenging to determine _or rule out_ under visual inspection.

Your antenna and coax will accumulate [ions](../../helium-glossary.md#ion) due to electricity passing through it ([TX/RX](../../helium-glossary.md#tx-rx)), when a storm passes through your area, or as the wind passes over it. Over time, this accumulation will [attenuate](../../helium-glossary.md#attenuation) your [signal](../../helium-glossary.md#signal) by negatively impacting your [SNR](../../helium-glossary.md#snr)/[RSSI](../../helium-glossary.md#rssi). Installing a [lightning arrester](../../helium-glossary.md#lightning-arrester) on the hotspot-end of your cable configuration will allow the static to leave your assembly naturally. Many [RF](../../helium-glossary.md#rf) professionals install an arrester at both ends: You must run **two** individual wire conductors if you do so. Connecting the two arresters will create feedback.  &#x20;

_The accumulation of static in your antenna/coax assembly can eventually beckon a lightning strike. Your_ [_hardware_](../../helium-glossary.md#hardware) _could be damaged without direct contact by a nearby lightning strike. Even over-accumulation of static can face you with the same substantial permanent damage, as will getting your antenna or mast too close to power lines. Tell someone you're working on your antenna before heading up a tower, roof, or under power lines, etc._

**Ground your antenna with a** [**lightning arrester**](../../helium-glossary.md#lightning-arrester) **in one of the following ways:**

1. **Dedicated** [**GROUND**](../../helium-glossary.md#ground)    ****      &#x20;

_Highly recommended -_ Hammer at least 4ft of a copper-coated grounding rod into the [earth's](../../helium-glossary.md#earth) soil as close to the [hotspot](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) as possible. Run a wire conductor from your arrester to your grounding rod. The priority is as short a wire run as possible.

&#x20; 2\. **Lightbox / House ground**&#x20;

This method is not preferred and may result in some [noise](../../helium-glossary.md#noise) remaining in your configuration. Follow these instructions if you're unable to provide a dedicated ground. _It's certainly better than nothing._  &#x20;

**Wire Length/Diameter recommendations;**

**12AWG/equiv. 1-10ft**&#x20;

**10AWG/equiv. 11-25ft**&#x20;

**8AWG/equiv. 26-50ft**   &#x20;

_It's not advised to surpass 50ft, lest your 'ground' become another accumulator._&#x20;

If you cannot ground your antenna to the earth, you can consider a ground plane, which can act as a ground by diverting excess static downward.

**There is an added benefit to safety in properly grounding your antenna. Doing so will improve your** [**SNR**](../../helium-glossary.md#snr)**/**[**RSSI**](../../helium-glossary.md#rssi)**, which can increase your activity and** [**rewards**](../../helium-glossary.md#reward)**.**
