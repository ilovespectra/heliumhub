# ðŸ“¡ Antenna

Issues that pertain to [beacons](../../helium-glossary.md#beacon) and [witnesses](../../helium-glossary.md#witness) are often [antenna](../../helium-glossary.md#antenna)-related.&#x20;

Causes

* Poor [Grounding](../../helium-glossary.md#ground)
* Low-Quality Antenna
* Insufficient [coax](../../helium-glossary.md#coax) diameter
* Antenna Short
* Coax Short
* [Hotspot](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) Short
* Poor Connection
* Damaged Connection

Name brand antennas will unconditionally outperform cheap knock-offs. You mine [$HNT ](../../helium-glossary.md#hnt)over [radio](../../helium-glossary.md#radio), so select a quality antenna, _like a_ [**RAKwireless Antenna**](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/outdoor-antennas). When running a [coax](../../helium-glossary.md#coax) or electrical cable, the thicker the coax cable is, the more insulation it has from [static](../../helium-glossary.md#static) accumulation, _and thicker electrical wiring enables longer runs with less voltage drop._&#x20;

LMR cable is a name brand cable produced by Times Microwave. You may see 'equivalent' LMR sold on other sites and antennas on low-price internet retail sites that _claim_ they're finely tuned and high quality. It's important not to cut corners when choosing an antenna or coaxial cable.&#x20;



**Recommended:** _Although many folks will run LMR400 26 ft (10m+)+._

**LMR400**: up to 10ft (3m)

**LMR500**: 10-26ft (3-10m)

**LMR600**: 26ft+ (10m+)

_Do not run coax longer than 50ft (20m), or it will accumulate too much static._

\*You can use this [Cable Attenuation Calculator](https://www.timesmicrowave.com/Calculator) to estimate a cableâ€™s [data](../../helium-glossary.md#data) drop&#x20;

The ideal antenna location is outside as high as possible. The attic takes 2nd place. Indoor antennas can be optimized by relocating the hotspot and antenna to the top floor and removing any metal screening from nearby windows, which will negatively [attenuate](../../helium-glossary.md#attenuation) your [signal](../../helium-glossary.md#signal).&#x20;
