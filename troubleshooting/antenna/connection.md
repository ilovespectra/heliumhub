# Connection

Your [hotspot](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) will stop performing [TX/RX](../../helium-glossary.md#tx-rx) in the event your ufl cable inside the hotspot comes loose from the [LoRa](../../helium-glossary.md#lora) Board. Typically due to over-tightening of the [antenna](../../helium-glossary.md#antenna) cable onto the hotspot. If your connection is not rigid upon inspection, power off your hotspot immediately, carefully remove the four screws from the top plate of your hotspot, and look inside.&#x20;

For example, inside a MNTD. hotspot should look like this:

_The ufl cable connects your female_ [_RP_](../../helium-glossary.md#rp)_-_[_SMA_](../../helium-glossary.md#sma) __ [_antenna_](../../helium-glossary.md#antenna) _connection on your hotspot to the uFL / Ipex connector on the board illustrated in the top left of the image above. If it has come loose, reattach it by returning the uFL connector and gently applying pressure straight down._

* **Moisture**&#x20;

Moisture entering your connections over time can cause failure. Always be sure to wrap connections with a waterproof tape, and provide a substantial drip loop when inserting the cable into enclosures or homes. If you believe moisture has penetrated your assembly, power down your [hotspot](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) immediately. Remove any tape, using isopropyl to clean the adhesive residue. Thoroughly inspect each connection and rejoin them, carefully reapplying your water barrier _or tape._

* **Static**

The accumulation of [static](../../helium-glossary.md#static) in your [antenna](../../helium-glossary.md#antenna) or [coax](../../helium-glossary.md#coax) can lead to a discharge that can permanently damage your [hardware](../../helium-glossary.md#hardware). Always mitigate static using an [arrester](../../helium-glossary.md#arrester) when possible. If you believe you may have experienced an antenna short, power down your hotspot immediately. Disconnect your configuration completely and carefully inspect for damage. You can test the continuity of your assembly using a voltmeter and your antenna with a signal tester.

* **Physical Damage**

[Coax](../../helium-glossary.md#coax) cable consists of an inner conductor core and an insulating layer around it to protect the cable from [static](../../helium-glossary.md#static). Excess manipulation to the cable can cause irreparable kinks in the inner core that will significantly impact your signal clarity. Take care when feeding cables through windows, even cables designed to do so. Please do not allow children or animals near cables with electricity flowing through them. Pets _or pests_ can chew through and ruin cable **at the risk of death**. If you believe your cable to be compromised, power down your [hotspot](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) immediately. Carefully inspect your entire assembly before rejoining and returning power to the hotspot.

* **Contact**

The inner conductor cores in your [coax](../../helium-glossary.md#coax) and [antenna](../../helium-glossary.md#antenna) assemblyâ€™s connections are delicate and can be damaged by mishandling, causing the pins to bend out of alignment. An improper adapter may be installed and allow two female connections to appear joined while failing to make a connection. If you're having trouble performing [proof of coverage](../../helium-glossary.md#proof-of-coverage), but your assembly appears undamaged otherwise, power down your hotspot and carefully inspect each connection point between the hotspot and the antenna.
