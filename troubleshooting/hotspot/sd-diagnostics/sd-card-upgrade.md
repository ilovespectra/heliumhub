# SD Card Upgrade

#### SD Card Upgrade Kit

The [SD card ](../../../helium-glossary.md#sd-card)MNTD. provides is [flashed](../../../helium-glossary.md#flash) and ready to be inserted into your [hotspot](../../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot). So long as you've got power and [Ethernet](../../../helium-glossary.md#ethernet) connectivity, the hotspot will automatically fetch the latest [firmware](../../../helium-glossary.md#firmware), [miner core](../../../helium-glossary.md#miner-core), and [snapshot](../../../helium-glossary.md#snapshot). Your[ Wi-Fi ](../../../helium-glossary.md#wi-fi)data is stored on your SD card, so after you replace it, you'll need to use [Helium Hotspot Utility](helium-hotspot-utility.md) to reconfigure your Wi-Fi credentials.
