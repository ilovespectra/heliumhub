# ⛏ Hotspot

Issues pertaining to [syncing](../../helium-glossary.md#sync), pairing, or undiagnosed inactivity may be [hotspot](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot)-related.

Causes

* [Validator](../../helium-glossary.md#validator) Connection
* [SD](../../helium-glossary.md#sd) Malfunction
* [SD](../../helium-glossary.md#sd) Failure
* Other [Hardware](../../helium-glossary.md#hardware) Failure

**Warning:**

When setting up your [hotspot](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot), bear in mind the operating temperatures of your hotspot and your router. _**The advised range for electronics is between 0-100 degrees Fahrenheit.**_ Be sure to protect from direct sun or extreme temperatures. Vent fans in enclosures encourage moisture, be mindful of your environment if you choose to do so. Electronics are prone to [static](../../helium-glossary.md#static) beneath 30% humidity and moisture damage above 50%. Staying between these boundaries can extend the life of your hardware by years. We strongly recommend using a temperature/humidity [sensor](../../helium-glossary.md#sensor) to monitor electronics enclosures.

**SD Malfunction:** _see “_[_SD / Diagnostics_](sd-diagnostics/)_”_
