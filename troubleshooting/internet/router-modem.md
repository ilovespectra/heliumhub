# Router / Modem

Sometimes a [router](../../helium-glossary.md#router) automatically updates settings, such as reassigning your [IP](../../helium-glossary.md#ip) address, which may cause a delay while your listen-address updates, or by raising new firewall settings, which may cause your [hotspot](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) to go offline completely. You can prevent this by assigning a static IP address using your hotspot's MAC address (from your [bluetooth](../../helium-glossary.md#bluetooth) [diagnostic](../../helium-glossary.md#diagnostic)) and correctly configuring your firewall settings. Hotspots used to require [port forwarding](../../helium-glossary.md#port-forwarding) to get the hotspot off of relay. Fortunately, this is no longer required. However, following the old steps to get off relay helps resolve most router-related issues.

Be sure to disable:

* Advanced Security
* UPnP
* Dynamic IP
* IPv6

Assign static DHCP address using MAC address from Bluetooth diagnostic.

The process may vary by router manufacturer. The easiest way to determine the steps for your model is to perform a [web search](../../helium-glossary.md#web-search) for the manual. Many useful workflows were created when hotspots still performed the task. Perform a web search for "Helium Fix Relay" to learn more.

Since the [Light Hotspot](../../helium-glossary.md#light-hotspots) upgrade release, the demand for [internet](../../helium-glossary.md#internet) speeds has been low, so [hotspots](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) do not consume much [data](../../helium-glossary.md#data). The most important factors of your [router](../../helium-glossary.md#router) are its firewall capabilities and its [Wi-Fi](../../helium-glossary.md#wi-fi) capability in the event you're unable to use [ethernet](../../helium-glossary.md#ethernet). (Ethernet is recommended) If you find the router provided by your [ISP ](../../helium-glossary.md#isp)is insufficient, you can save [money](../../helium-glossary.md#money) on your bill by purchasing one with improved Wi-Fi or firewall capabilities on your own.
