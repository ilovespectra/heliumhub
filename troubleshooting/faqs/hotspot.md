# Hotspot

### **How do I know what** [**firmware**](../../helium-glossary.md#firmware) **Iâ€™m on?**

[Helium](../../helium-glossary.md#helium) [Hotspots](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) automatically fetch the latest[ internal miner core](../../helium-glossary.md#internal-miner-core) at least once every 24 hours, so if you've had power and [internet](../../helium-glossary.md#internet) for the last 24 hours, it is safe to assume your hotspot is up to date.

_View the firmware on your_ [_SD cards_](../../helium-glossary.md#sd-card) _like the IOS of your smartphone and the_ [_internal miner core_](../../helium-glossary.md#internal-miner-core) _updates like a mobile app update. When you update an app to the latest version, your phone will continue to show the same IOS. Similarly, when you view the firmware on your diagnostic, you'll see the firmware on the hotspot (Your IOS) but not the app version (Core releases)._
