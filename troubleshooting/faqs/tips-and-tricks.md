# Tips-and-Tricks

### **How do I improve my** [**transmitting scale**](../../helium-glossary.md#transmission-scale)**?**

Your transmit scale reflects the density of [hotspots](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) within your area based on the limitations of your various [hexagon resolutions](../../helium-glossary.md#hexagon-resolution). When considering your transmission scale, bear in mind that the primary impact of your transmission scale is the size of the [reward](../../helium-glossary.md#reward) given to the hotspots that [witness](../../helium-glossary.md#wireless) your [beacons](../../helium-glossary.md#beacon). Your [earnings](../../helium-glossary.md#earnings) are determined by the quantity and transmission scale of the beacons you witness. The only way to increase your transmit scale is to move it to an area where there are fewer hotspots. _(In real life, not just on the map.)_ This incentivizes unique hotspot placement that promotes optimized network growth. 1.0 transmission scales are great for the network, but I know many folks are far more concerned with their rewards than the network growth and usage _and all that stuff._ I hear you. So, here's the fact of the matter: As far as maximizing your hotspot's earnings is concerned:

_**You want to see 1.0 more than be 1.0**_

_To counter the effects of being in an area with low transmit scales, I recommend that you improve your hotspot's_ [_antenna_ ](../antenna/)_setup so it can witness beacons of hotspots located further away that might have higher transmit scales._

### **Can I use more than one** [**hotspot**](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) **at a house?**

Short answer, No.

### Why can't I use more than 1 [hotspot](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) in the same location?

The way the[ Helium network](../../helium-glossary.md#helium) was designed promotes unique hotspot placement by providing better [rewards](../../helium-glossary.md#reward) to hotspots that provide more meaningful [network coverage](../../helium-glossary.md#network-coverage). Doing so, you can expect reduced rewards and risk getting added to the [denylist](../../helium-glossary.md#helium-denylist).

_The_ [_Helium Denylist_](https://www.heliumboard.com/denylist) _is an open-source list created and maintained by the Helium community used to block hotspots proven to be manipulating the network to increase their_ [_rewards_ ](../../helium-glossary.md#reward)_via_ [_spoofing_](../../helium-glossary.md#spoofing) _their location or otherwise. Not to mention being generally ill-regarded by the Helium Community. There are more than enough reasons to find a unique location for all your hotspots._

### ****[**Hotspots**](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) **near me seem to be making more than me.**

If you'd like to optimize your [earnings](../../helium-glossary.md#earnings), you'll need to optimize the [coverage](../../helium-glossary.md#coverage) you're providing. By upgrading your [antenna](../../helium-glossary.md#antenna) or moving your hotspot to a unique location, you will be rewarded for providing the Helium Network with more meaningful coverage.

### **Why do** [**Helium**](../../helium-glossary.md#helium) **devs keep putting out updates!?**

Each update that Helium implements represents a necessary fix to accommodate the longevity and success of the [network](../../helium-glossary.md#network). We may experience network instability while these updates level out, possibly spending some time offline. In most circumstances, [hotspots](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) will automatically come back online and begin performing [proof of coverage ](../../helium-glossary.md#proof-of-coverage)again.
