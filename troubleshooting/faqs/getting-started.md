# Getting Started

### **How long before my miner is earning?**

This can depend on your area. [Hotspots](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) need to “see” one another to perform [proof of coverage](../../helium-glossary.md#proof-of-coverage). The more hotspots around yours, the more often it will have the opportunity to [witness](../../helium-glossary.md#witness) a [beacon](../../helium-glossary.md#beacon) or receive witnesses from beacons sent. Upon providing your hotspot with power and [internet](../../helium-glossary.md#internet), your hotspot will begin seeking to pair with a [validator](../../helium-glossary.md#validator).

_The length of time this process takes is impacted by your internet speed and several other network factors that can make determining an ETA on activity difficult. Sometimes a hotspot is_ [_mining_](../../helium-glossary.md#mining) _within a couple of hours of plugging it in, but sometimes it can take a week or more. In most cases, it's just a couple of days before we see our new hotspots proving their coverage and earning_ [_HNT_](../../helium-glossary.md#hnt) _on the_ [_Helium blockchain_.](../../helium-glossary.md#helium-blockchain)
