# Onboarding

**Be sure you've connected to** [**ethernet**](../../helium-glossary.md#ethernet) **for a half hour or so before trying to onboard.** If ethernet is unavailable, use [Hotspot Utility](../hotspot/sd-diagnostics/helium-hotspot-utility.md). This app will allow you to pair in the event [Helium App](../../helium-glossary.md#helium-app) will not.
