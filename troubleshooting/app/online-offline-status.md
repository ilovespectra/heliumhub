# Online / Offline Status

Since May 11th, 2022, [Helium](../../helium-glossary.md#helium) [hotspots](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) no longer have to [sync](../../helium-glossary.md#sync) with the [blockchain](../../helium-glossary.md#helium-blockchain). If [Helium App](../../helium-glossary.md#helium-app) shows a sync status, you should **write down your** [**seed phrase**](../../helium-glossary.md#seed-phrase) **** and reinstall the app, and this will update you to the latest version. You can view current hotspot data on various apps and websites we've recommended [here](../faqs/resources.md). If you cannot [ping](../../helium-glossary.md#ping) your [hotspot](../../helium-glossary.md#hotspot), perform a [Bluetooth](../../helium-glossary.md#bluetooth) [diagnostic](../../helium-glossary.md#diagnostic) and send the results to our tech support team on [Discord](../../helium-glossary.md#discord).

[Validators](../../helium-glossary.md#validator) now carry the weight of the computational demand of the [network](../../helium-glossary.md#helium), and Helium is still making regular improvements to the [Light Hotspot](../../helium-glossary.md#light-hotspots) upgrade. There are various reasons your validator could lose connection with your hotspot, or that may cause you to see irregularities in [explorer](../../helium-glossary.md#helium-explore). Sometimes [rebooting](../../helium-glossary.md#reboot) the hotspot can help resolve this issue. _Do not do so more than once a day._
