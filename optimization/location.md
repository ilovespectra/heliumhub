# Location

Location can make or break a deployment. Redundant [coverage](../helium-glossary.md#coverage) is not rewarded on the [Helium](../helium-glossary.md#helium) network, so for optimal rewards you’ll want to provide unique coverage. You can do a bit of homework before pulling the trigger on a deployment.&#x20;

Helium imposes limitations on the number of [hotspots](../helium-glossary.md#hotspot) in a given area. Use [Hotspotty](https://hotspotty.net/) to learn more about [resolution hexagons](../helium-glossary.md#hexagon-resolution). The [Helium explorer ](../helium-glossary.md#helium-explore)displays the resolution 8 hex by default, which has a limit independent from larger hexes. _Hotspots in the same location will not provide unique coverage, so they will split rewards with each other._&#x20;

[Hotspotty](https://hotspotty.net/) allows you to view hotspot limitations based on resolution hex size. The larger the hex, the more hotspots are permitted in the space. Knowing proper hotspot density will allow you to determine the ideal location for your deployment. _You want a balance between too few hotspots, which will result in reduced_ [_PoC_](../helium-glossary.md#proof-of-coverage)_, and too many hotspots, which will result in reduced_ [_rewards_](../helium-glossary.md#reward)_._

[HotspotRF ](https://hotspotrf.com/)can estimate [witness](../helium-glossary.md#witness) count in [antenna](../helium-glossary.md#antenna) simulations that take location and elevation into consideration. This is an invaluable resource that can save you a lot of time by eliminating insubstantial areas from your prospective locations for a [host](../helium-glossary.md#host) or an [off-grid](../helium-glossary.md#off-grid) deployment.

* View the map on [Helium Explorer](https://explorer.helium.com/) using the [transmission scale](../helium-glossary.md#transmission-scale) [filter](../helium-glossary.md#filter), and explore for large areas of green, taking note of the location.&#x20;
* Swap to the [rewards](../helium-glossary.md#reward) filter and see who’s providing the most meaningful coverage, indicated by blue hexes, taking note of the location.&#x20;

View the location of blue hexes using Google Earth in 3D. Note the geographical advantage of these spots, typically hills, mountains, or radio towers. Elevation alone may not guarantee better rewards, you’ll want to witness more hotspots with a 1.0 trans scale.&#x20;
